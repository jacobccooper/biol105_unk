    "text": "2.2 Installing RStudio\nRStudio is a GUI (graphics user interface) that helps make R easier to use. Furthermore, it allows you to create documents in R, including websites (such as this one), PDFs, and even presentations. This can greatly streamline the research pipeline and help you publish your results and associated code in a quick and efficient fashion.\nHead over the the RStudio download website and download “RStudio Desktop”, which is free. Be sure to pick the correct version for your machine.\nOpen RStudio on your machine. You should be presented with something like the following:\n\n\n\nRStudio start window. Note that the screen is split into four different quadrants. Top left: R documents; bottom left: R program; top right: environment window; bottom right: plots, help, and directories.\n\n\nIn RStudio, the top left window is always going to be our coding window. This is where we will type all of our code and create our documents. In the bottom left we will see R executing the code. This will show what the computer is “thinking” and will help us spot any potential issues. The top right window is the “environment”, which shows what variables and datasets are stored within the computers’ memory. (It can also show some other things, but we aren’t concerned with that at this point). The bottom right window is the “display” window. This is where plots and help windows will appear if they don’t appear in the document (top left) window itself.\nNow, we will create our first R document!",

    "text": "3.1 Setup\nIn this class, we will be creating assignments in what is called RMarkdown. This is a rich-text version of R that allows us to create documents with the code embedded. In RStudio, click the “+” button in the far top left to open the New Document menu. Scroll down this list and click on R Markdown.\nA screen such as this will appear:\n\n\n\nA new file window for an RMarkdown file.\n\n\nAfter entering a title and your name and selecting document in the left hand menu, click OK.\n\n\n\nAn example of a markdown script.\n\n\nIn the image above, we can see what a “default” RMarkdown script looks like after creating the file. At the top of the document, between all of the dashes, we have the yaml header that tells R what kind of document will be created, who the author is, and tells it to use today’s date. In this class, we will be saving documents as html as they are the easiest documents to create and save. These documents will include all of your code, text, and even any plots you may create!\nPlain text in the document will be rendered as plain text in the document. (I.e., whatever you type normally will become “normal text” in the finished document). Lines preceded with # will become headers, with ## being a second level header and ### being a third level header, etc. Words can also be made italic by putting an asterisk on each side of the word (*italic*) and bold by putting two asterisks on each side (**bold**). URLs are also supported, with &lt;&gt; on each side of a URL making it clickable, and words being hyperlinked by typing [words to show](target URL).\nWe also have code “chunks” that are shown above. A code chunk can be manually typed out or inserted by pressing CTRL + ALT + I (Windows, Linux) or COMMAND + OPTION + I (Mac). Everything inside a “code chunk” will be read as R code and executed as such. Note that you can have additional commands in the R chunks, but we won’t cover that for now.",

It is important you do this step up front as the computer will sometimes save in random places if you don’t specify a file location at the beginning. Don’t forget to save your work frequently!\n\n\n\nText to type in your Rmarkdown document.\n\n\nAfter typing this into the document, hit knit near the top of the upper left window. R will now create an HTML document that should look like this:\n\n\n\nThe output from the above code knitted into a document.\n\n\nWe can see now that the HTML document has the title of the document, the author’s name, the date on which the code was run, and a greyed-out box with color coded R code followed by the output. Let’s try something a little more complex. Create a new code chunk and type the following:\n\nx &lt;- 1:10\n\nThis will create a variable in R, x, that is sequentially each whole number between 1 and 10. We can see this by highlighting or typing only the letter x and running that line of code by clicking CTRL + ENTER (Windows / Linux) or COMMAND + ENTER (Mac).\n\nx\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nIf you look at the top right window, you will also see the value x in the environment defined as int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. This indicates that x is integer data spanning ten positions numbered 1 to 10. Since the vector is small, it displays every number in the sequence.\n\n\n\nRStudio environment window showing saved objects. These are in the computer’s memory.\n\n\nLet’s create another vector y that is the squared values of x, such that \\(y=x^2\\). We can raise values to an exponent by using ^.\n\ny &lt;- x^2\ny\n\n [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100\n\n\nNow we have the value y in the environment that is the square of the values of x. This is a numeric vector of 10 values numbered 1 to 10 where each value corresponds to a square of the x value. We can raise things to any value however, including \\(x^x\\)!\n\nx^x\n\n [1]           1           4          27         256        3125       46656\n [7]      823543    16777216   387420489 10000000000\n\n\nAs we can see, since I didn’t “store” this value as a variable in R using &lt;-, the value is not in the environment.",

This is easy in R, as we just use the command plot.\n\nplot(x = x, y = y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy specifying the y and x components in plot, we can quickly generate a point plot. We can alter the visual parameters of this plot using a few different commands. I will outline these below with inline notes. Inline notes in the code can be made by using a # symbol before them, which basically tells R to ignore everything after the #. For example:\n\nprint(\"Test\")\n\n[1] \"Test\"\n\n# print(\"Test 2\")\n\nThis prints the word Test, but doesn’t print Test 2.\nNow let’s make the plot with some new visual parameters.\n\nplot(x = x, # specify x values\n     y = y, # specify y values\n     ylab = \"Y Values\", # specify Y label\n     xlab = \"X Values\", # specify X label\n     main = \"Plot Title\", # specify main title\n     pch = 19, # adjust point style\n     col = \"red\") # make points red",

This is great if you know a specific index, but it is better to use a specific name.\nvar[rows,\"cols\"] is a way to do the above but by using a specific column name, like combined_current_km2.\nvar$colname is a way to call the specific column name directly from the dataset.\n\n\n# using R functions\n\nranges$combined_current_km2\n\n [1]  25209.4  68171.2  60939.2  27021.3  78679.9   8769.9 232377.2  17401.4\n [9]  51853.5  35455.1  23570.3 187179.1\n\n\nAs shown above, calling the specific column name with $ allows us to see only the data of interest.

    "section": "2.4 Descriptive statistics",
    "text": "2.4 Descriptive statistics\nDescriptive statistics are statistics that help us understand the shape and nature of the data on hand. These include really common metrics such as mean, median, and mode, as well as more nuanced metrics like quartiles that help us understand if there is any skew in the dataset. (Skew refers to a bias in the data, where more data points lie on one side of the distribution and there is a long tail of data in the other direction).\n\n\n\nExamples of skew compared to a symmetrical, non-skewed distribution. Source: machinelearningparatodos.com\n\n\nNote above that the relative position of the mean, median, and mode can be indicative of skew. Please also note that these values will rarely be exactly equal “in the real world”, and thus you need to weigh differences against the entire dataset when assessing skew. There is a lot of nuance like this in statistics; it is not always an “exact” science, but sometimes involves judgment calls and assessments based on what you observe in the data.\nUsing the starbucks dataset, we can look at some of these descriptive statistics to understand what is going on.\n\n2.4.1 Notation\nAs a quick reminder, we use Greek lettering for populations and Roman lettering for samples. For example:\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) is a population, but \\(s\\) is a sample (both these variables refer to standard deviation).\n\\(\\mu\\) is a population, but \\(\\bar{x}\\) is a sample (both of these variables refer to the mean).\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Mean\nThe mean is the “average” value within a set of data, specifically, the sum of all values divided by the length of those values: \\(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nx}{n}\\).\n\nhead(starbucks)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  Hour      Frap_Num\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0600-0659        2\n2 0700-0759        3\n3 0800-0859        2\n4 0900-0959        4\n5 1000-1059        8\n6 1100-1159        7\n\n\nHere, we are specifically interested in the number of frappuccinos.\n\n# get vector of frappuccino number\nfraps &lt;- starbucks$Frap_Num\n\n# get mean of vector\nmean(fraps)\n\n[1] 6.222222\n\n\nNote that the above should be rounded to a whole number, since we were given the data in whole numbers!\n\nmean(fraps) %&gt;%\n  round(0)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nWe already covered calculating the average manually in our previous tutorial, but we can do that here as well:\n\n# sum values\n# divide by n, length of vector\n# round to 0 places\nround(sum(fraps)/length(fraps),0)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Range\nThe range is the difference between the largest and smallest units in a dataset. We can use the commands min and max to calculate this.\n\nmax(fraps) - min(fraps)\n\n[1] 13\n\n\nThe range of our dataset is 13.\n\n\n2.4.4 Median\nThe median is also known as the 50th percentile, and is the midpoint of the data when ordered from least to greatest. If there are an even number of data points, then it is the average point between the two center points. For odd data, this is the \\(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\)th observation. For even data, since we need to take an average, this is the \\(\\frac{\\frac{n}{2}+(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}{2}\\). You should be able to do these by hand and by using a program.\n\nmedian(fraps)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nNow, to calculate by hand:\n\nlength(fraps)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nWe have an odd length.\n\n# order gets the order\norder(fraps)\n\n[1] 1 3 7 2 4 6 5 9 8\n\n\n\n# [] tells R which elements to put where\nfrap_order &lt;- fraps[order(fraps)]\n\nfrap_order\n\n[1]  2  2  2  3  4  7  8 13 15\n\n\n\n# always use parentheses\n# make sure the math maths right!\n(length(frap_order)+1)/2\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nWhich is the fifth element in the vector?\n\nfrap_order[5]\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nNow let’s try it for an even numbers.\n\n# remove first element\neven_fraps &lt;- fraps[-1]\n\neven_fraps_order &lt;- even_fraps[order(even_fraps)]\n\neven_fraps_order\n\n[1]  2  2  3  4  7  8 13 15\n\n\n\nmedian(even_fraps)\n\n[1] 5.5\n\n\nNow, by hand: \\(\\frac{\\frac{n}{2}+(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}{2}\\).\n\nn &lt;- length(even_fraps_order)\n\n# get n/2 position from vector\nm1 &lt;- even_fraps_order[n/2]\n# get n/2+1 position\nm2 &lt;- even_fraps_order[(n/2)+1]\n\n# add these values, divide by two for \"midpoint\"\nmed &lt;- (m1+m2)/2\n\nmed\n\n[1] 5.5\n\n\nAs we can see, these values are equal!\n\n\n2.4.5 Other quartiles and quantiles\nWe also use the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile to understand data distributions. These are calculated similar to the above, but the bottom quartile is only \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the way between values and the 75th quartile is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the way between values. We can use the R function quantile to calculate these.\n\nquantile(frap_order)\n\n  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% \n   2    2    4    8   15 \n\n\nWe can specify a quantile as well:\n\nquantile(frap_order, 0.75)\n\n75% \n  8 \n\n\nWe can also calculate these metrics by hand. Let’s do it for the even dataset, since this is more difficult.\n\nquantile(even_fraps_order)\n\n   0%   25%   50%   75%  100% \n 2.00  2.75  5.50  9.25 15.00 \n\n\nNote that the 25th and 75th percentiles are also between two different values. These can be calculated as a quarter and three-quarters of the way between their respective values.\n\n# 75th percentile\n\nn &lt;- length(even_fraps_order)\n\n# get position\np &lt;- 0.75*(n+1)\n\n# get lower value\n# round down\nm1 &lt;- even_fraps_order[trunc(p)]\n\n# get upper value\n# round up\nm2 &lt;- even_fraps_order[ceiling(p)]\n\n# position between\n# fractional portion of rank\nfrac &lt;- p-trunc(p)\n\n# calculate the offset from lowest value\nval &lt;- (m2 - m1)*frac\n\n# get value\nm1 + val\n\n[1] 11.75\n\n\nWait… why does our value differ?\nR, by default, calculates quantiles using what is called Type 7, in which the quantiles are calculated by \\(p_k = \\frac{k-1}{n-1}\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the vector and \\(k\\) refers to the quantile being used. However, in our book and in this class, we use Type 6 interpretation - \\(p_k = \\frac{k}{n + 1}\\). Let’s try using Type 6:\n\nquantile(even_fraps_order, type = 6)\n\n   0%   25%   50%   75%  100% \n 2.00  2.25  5.50 11.75 15.00 \n\n\nNow we have the same answer as we calculated by hand!\nThis is a classic example of how things in R (and in statistics in general!) can depend on interpretation and are not always “hard and fast” rules.\nIn this class, we will be using Type 6 interpretation for the quantiles - you will have to specify this in the quantile function EVERY TIME! If you do not specify Type 6, you will get the questions incorrect and you will get answers that do not agree with the book, with Excel, or what you calculate by hand.\n\n\n2.4.6 Mode\nThere is no default method for finding the mode in R. However, websites like Statology provide wraparound functions.\n\n# Statology function\n# define function to calculate mode\nfind_mode &lt;- function(x) {\n  # get unique values from vector\n  u &lt;- unique(x)\n  # count number of occurrences for each value\n  tab &lt;- tabulate(match(x, u))\n  # return the value with the highest count\n  u[tab == max(tab)]\n}\n\nfind_mode(fraps)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nWe can also do this by hand, by counting the number of occurrences of each value. This can be done in a stepwise fashion using commands in the above function.\n\n# unique counts\nu &lt;- unique(fraps)\nu\n\n[1]  2  3  4  8  7 15 13\n\n\n\n# which elements match\nmatch(fraps,u)\n\n[1] 1 2 1 3 4 5 1 6 7\n\n\n\n# count them\ntab &lt;- match(fraps,u) %&gt;%\n  tabulate()\n\ntab\n\n[1] 3 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nGet the highest value.\n\nu[tab==max(tab)]\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nNotice this uses ==. This is a logical argument that means “is equal to” or “is the same as”. For example:\n\n2 == 2\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThese values are the same, so TRUE is returned.\n\n2 == 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThese values are unequal, so FALSE is returned. R will read TRUE as 1 and FALSE as ZERO, such that:\n\nsum(2==2)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nand\n\nsum(2==3)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThis allows you to find how many arguments match your condition quickly, and even allows you to subset based on these indices as well. Keep in mind you can use greater than &lt;, less than &gt;, greater than or equal to &lt;=, less than or equal to &gt;=, is equal to ==, and is not equal to != to identify numerical relationships. Other logical arguments include:\n\n&: both conditions must be TRUE to match (e.g., c(10,20) & c(20,10)). Try the following as well: fraps &lt; 10 & fraps &gt; 3.\n&&: and, but works with single elements and allows for better parsing. Often used with if. E.g., fraps &lt; 10 && fraps &gt; 3. This will not work on our multi-element frap vector.\n|: or, saying at least one condition must be true. Try: fraps &gt; 10 | fraps &lt; 3.\n||: or, but for a single element, like && above.\n!: not, so “not equal to” would be !=.\n\n\n\n2.4.7 Variance\nWhen we are dealing with datasets, the variance is a measure of the total spread of the data. The variance is calculated using the following:\\[\\sigma^2=\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\\]\nEssentially, this means that for every value of \\(x\\), we are finding the difference between that value and the mean and squaring it, summing all of these quared differences, and dividing them by the number of samples in the dataset minus one. Let’s do this for the frappuccino dataset.\n\nfrap_order\n\n[1]  2  2  2  3  4  7  8 13 15\n\n\nNow to find the differences.\n\ndiffs &lt;- frap_order - mean(frap_order)\n\ndiffs\n\n[1] -4.2222222 -4.2222222 -4.2222222 -3.2222222 -2.2222222  0.7777778  1.7777778\n[8]  6.7777778  8.7777778\n\n\nNote that R is calculating the same thing for the entire vector! Since these are differences from the mean, they should sum to zero.\n\nsum(diffs)\n\n[1] 3.552714e-15\n\n\nThis is not quite zero due to rounding error, but is essentially zero as it is 0.0000000000000036.\n\n# square differences\ndiffs_sq &lt;- diffs^2\n\ndiffs_sq\n\n[1] 17.8271605 17.8271605 17.8271605 10.3827160  4.9382716  0.6049383  3.1604938\n[8] 45.9382716 77.0493827\n\n\nNow we have the squared differences. We need to sum these and divide by \\(n-1\\).\n\nn &lt;- length(frap_order)\n\nvar_frap &lt;- sum(diffs_sq)/(n-1)\n\nvar_frap\n\n[1] 24.44444\n\n\nLet’s check this against the built-in variance function in R.\n\nvar(frap_order)\n\n[1] 24.44444\n\n\nThey are identical! We can check this using a logical argument.\n\nvar_frap == var(frap_order)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nSeeing as this is TRUE, we calculated it correctly.\n\n\n2.4.8 Standard deviation\nAnother common measurement of spread is the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). As you remember from class (or may have guessed from the notation on this site), the standard deviation is just the square root of the variance.\n\nsqrt(var_frap)\n\n[1] 4.944132\n\n\nWe can test this against the built in sd function in R:\n\nsqrt(var_frap) == sd(frap_order)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAs you can see, we calculated this correctly!\n\n\n2.4.9 Standard error\nThe standard error is used to help understand the spread of data and to help estimate the accuracy of our measurements for things like the mean. The standard error is calculated thusly:\n\\[\nSE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nThere is not built in function for the standard error in excel, but we can write our own:\n\nse &lt;- function(x){\n  n &lt;- length(x) # calculate n\n  s &lt;- sd(x) # calculate standard deviation\n  se_val &lt;- s/sqrt(n)\n  return(se_val)\n}\n\nLet’s test this code.\n\nse(frap_order)\n\n[1] 1.648044\n\n\nOur code works! And we can see exactly how the standard error is calculate. We can also adjust this code as needed for different situations, like samples.\nRemember, the standard error is used to help reflect our confidence in a specific measurement (e.g., how certain we are of the mean, and what values we believe the mean falls between). We want our estimates to be as precise as possible with as little uncertainty as possible. Given this, does having more samples make our estimates more or less confident? Mathematically, what happens as our sample size increases?\n\n\n2.4.10 Coefficient of variation\nThe coefficient of variation, another measure of data spread and location, is calculated by the following:\n\\[\nCV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\n\\]\nWe can write a function to calculate this in R as well.\n\ncv &lt;- function(x){\n  sigma &lt;- sd(x)\n  mu &lt;- mean(x)\n  val &lt;- sigma/mu\n  return(val)\n}\n\ncv(frap_order)\n\n[1] 0.7945927\n\n\nRemember that we will need to round values.\n\n\n2.4.11 Outliers\nOutliers are any values that are outside of the 1.5 times the interquartile range. We can calculate this for our example dataset as follows:\n\nlowquant &lt;- quantile(frap_order,0.25,type = 6)\n\nhiquant &lt;- quantile(frap_order,0.75,type = 6)\n\niqr &lt;- hiquant - lowquant\n\nlowbound &lt;- mean(frap_order) - (1.5*iqr)\nhibound &lt;- mean(frap_order) + (1.5*iqr)\n\n# low outliers?\n# select elements that match\n# identify using logical \"which\"\nfrap_order[which(frap_order &lt; lowbound)]\n\nnumeric(0)\n\n\n\n# high outliers?\n# select elements that match\n# identify using logical \"which\"\nfrap_order[which(frap_order &gt; hibound)]\n\nnumeric(0)\n\n\nWe have no outliers for this particular dataset.",

Parting thoughts about the course.

## ᏙᏓᏓᎪᎲᎢ

ᏙᏓᏓᎪᎲᎢ (pronounced *doh-dah-dah-go-huh-ee*) is a traditional Cherokee farewell. It does not mean goodbye, but rather reflects a parting of ways until a group of folks meet again.

I enjoyed getting to know all of you in class, and please feel free to reach out or stop by and say hi if you are ever passing through Kearney in the future or if you need help with something biology related.

Wishing you the best,

Dr. Cooper
